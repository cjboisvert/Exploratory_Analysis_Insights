# Exploratory_Analysis_Insights
Assignment as part of LSE Data Analytics course. 
This was a 6-week summative assessment for the first module. The purpose was to conduct multi-platform analysis on a series of data and to present insights to stakeholders using Tableau. 

Data was first cleaned and analysed using Excel, then transferred to SQL to be queried, and finally to Tableau for joining the dataframes to create stakeholder visualisations. 

The business context for the mandate is as follows:
